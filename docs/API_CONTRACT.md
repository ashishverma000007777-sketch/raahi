# Raahi — Canonical API Contract (Phase 1)

Scope: features that actually exist in the Raahi Flutter app today, plus Vehicle/Car
Health (added post-MVP as a real, user-data-driven feature — see "Vehicle & Car Health"
below and STATUS.md's "CAR HEALTH — REAL FEATURE" entry). Fair Price Check / Road Trip /
Vehicle Documents remain excluded — they still have no reference implementation and are
pending a product decision.

Base path: `/api/v1`
Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` issued by our backend after Firebase
token verification (Firebase remains the identity provider; our JWT is
what every subsequent request uses — same pattern as today, just enforced
consistently).

All responses follow one envelope, everywhere, no exceptions:

Success: `{ "success": true, "data": { ... } }`
Error:   `{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "STRING_CODE", "message": "..." } }`

## Resolved conflicts (Flutter said X, Node said Y → final answer)

- SOS trigger: Flutter called `POST /sos`, Node expected `POST /sos/trigger` → final: `POST /sos`
- My jobs: Flutter called `GET /jobs/my-jobs`, Node had `GET /jobs/my` → final: `GET /jobs/mine`
- Selfie admin review: Flutter called `GET /selfie/pending`, Node had `GET /admin/selfies/pending` → final: `GET /admin/selfies/pending` (Flutter side gets fixed to match)
- FCM token: Flutter called `PUT /auth/fcm-token`, Node had nothing → final: implemented as `PUT /auth/fcm-token`
- Daily tips: Flutter called `GET /daily/tips`, Node had nothing → final: implemented, real rotating content, clearly presented as non-live
- Nearby places: Flutter called `GET /daily/places`, Node had nothing → final: `GET /places/nearby` via a PlacesProvider abstraction
- Aadhaar: Flutter called `POST /aadhaar/send-otp` + `verify-otp`, Node had nothing → final: OTP dropped entirely (not needed per spec), new `POST /aadhaar/submit` does image upload + AI tamper screen only
- WebSocket auth: both sides trusted `?userId=` in the query string → final: `wss://.../ws?token=<JWT>`, server derives identity from the verified JWT and never trusts the query param
- AI chat session: client-supplied `session_id` was never checked against `user_id` → final: server verifies `session.user_id == authenticated user` on every message, 403 otherwise
- Job accept race: `UPDATE ... WHERE status='pending'` worked but had no row lock → final: wrapped in a transaction with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the job row
- Mechanics-nearby fallback: backend returned fake mechanics when the DB was empty → final: removed, returns an empty result with "No verified mechanics found nearby"

## Endpoints (final)

**Auth**
- `POST /auth/verify` — body: `{ idToken, requestedRole? }` → verifies Firebase token, creates/loads user, returns `{ token, isNewUser, user, subscription }`. Replaces `verifyOtp` + `verify-firebase` (one canonical endpoint, no legacy alias).
- `GET /auth/me`
- `PUT /auth/profile`
- `PUT /auth/location` — body: `{ lat, lng }`; persists to `users.last_lat/last_lng/last_location_at`
  (fixed during the build-blocker pass — previously validated input and returned
  `{"updated": true}` without storing anything at all). Not currently read by any other
  endpoint or consumed by the Android client — general presence data for future use.
- `PUT /auth/fcm-token` — body: `{ token }`

**Jobs (roadside help marketplace)**
- `POST /jobs` — subscription is NOT required in the MVP (`raahi.subscription.enforce-job-creation=false`). When `RAAHI_SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE_JOB_CREATION=true`, DRIVER accounts without an active subscription get 402.
- `GET /jobs`, `POST /jobs/{id}/accept` — approved, ACTIVE HELPER/MECHANIC only (role read from DB); DRIVER/ADMIN get 403
- `GET /jobs` — nearby pending jobs for helpers
- `GET /jobs/mine` — jobs where the caller is *either* the requester or the accepted
  helper (found while wiring Android Home: this originally only matched the requester side,
  so a MECHANIC/HELPER account's own in-progress job never showed up in their own "my jobs" —
  fixed at `JobRepository.findMine`, not worked around client-side)
- `POST /jobs/{id}/accept`
- `POST /jobs/{id}/verify-otp` — body `{ otp }`. New this session, while wiring the Android
  Jobs screens: the old Node backend had no way to actually verify the OTP handoff at all —
  a "matched" job showed the requester an OTP with nothing on the other end checking it, and
  `complete` had no status check, so either participant could mark a job COMPLETED straight
  from "pending"/"matched" with no handoff ever confirmed. Only the assigned helper may call
  this, only from MATCHED, only with the correct OTP → moves to IN_PROGRESS.
- `GET /jobs/{id}`
- `POST /jobs/{id}/complete` — now requires status IN_PROGRESS (i.e. verify-otp must have run
  first); previously callable from any status, which is what let the OTP step be skipped
- `POST /jobs/{id}/cancel` — new; spec requires cancellation support, didn't exist before

JobDto (all endpoints): `id, status, problemType, problemDesc, lat, lng, rewardAmount,
requesterName, helperName, viewerRole` always present. `viewerRole` is `"REQUESTER"` or
`"HELPER"` (whichever the caller actually is on that job), computed server-side rather than
left for the client to guess by matching names — added while building Android's "My Jobs"
list, which mixes jobs from both sides of the marketplace. `helperOtp` only present for the
requester. `helperPhone`/`helperRatingAvg`/`helperTotalHelps`/`helperVerified` only present
once a helper is assigned. `requesterPhone` only present for the assigned helper (mirrors
helperPhone) — added this session; the old Node `GET /jobs/:id` returned *both* parties'
phone numbers to any authenticated caller with no participant check at all, which is not
reproduced here.

**Mechanics**
- `GET /mechanics/nearby?lat&lng&radius` — filtered to `verification_status = APPROVED` with
  a location on file; does NOT also filter by `is_available` — an approved mechanic marked
  unavailable still appears (with `isAvailable: false` so the client can show it), on the
  view that "nearby verified mechanics, however busy" is more useful for a driver deciding
  who to call than silently hiding some of them. Android (Phase 6C) renders availability as
  a green/red marker + badge rather than filtering it further client-side.
- `GET /mechanics/{id}`
- `PUT /mechanics/location`
- No `POST` to request a *specific* mechanic — the job marketplace has no concept of
  targeting one mechanic (any eligible helper accepts a posted job). Android's mechanic
  detail screen's CTA opens the real Request Help flow instead of a fake per-mechanic
  request — the Flutter reference's equivalent button showed a "Request sent!" dialog with
  no backend call behind it at all, not reproduced.

**Vehicle & Car Health** (added post-MVP — real, user-entered data only; see
STATUS.md's "CAR HEALTH — REAL FEATURE" entry for the full design rationale)
- `GET /vehicles/me` — the caller's own vehicle; 404 `VEHICLE_NOT_FOUND` if they haven't
  completed "Set up your car" yet. Android uses this 404 specifically to trigger the setup
  flow, not any other error path.
- `PUT /vehicles/me` — create-or-update (same endpoint for first-time setup and later edits).
  Required: `brand`, `model`, `modelYear`, `fuelType` (`PETROL`/`DIESEL`/`CNG`/`ELECTRIC`/
  `HYBRID`/`LPG`), `registrationNumber`, `odometerKm`. Optional: `variant`,
  `lastServiceDate`/`lastServiceOdometerKm`, `insuranceExpiry`, `pucExpiry`,
  `tyreReplacedDate`/`tyreReplacedOdometerKm`, `batteryReplacedDate`/
  `batteryReplacedOdometerKm` (all dates ISO `yyyy-MM-dd`). Nothing here is collected that
  the backend can't actually persist — no fields beyond this list exist anywhere in the flow.
- `PUT /vehicles/me/odometer` — body `{ odometerKm }`. Rejects a value lower than the current
  reading (`400 ODOMETER_DECREASED`) — there is no correction/rollback flow yet, so a genuine
  correction currently requires direct DB access; flagged as a known gap, not silently allowed.
  Every successful update is also appended to an odometer log table (audit trail, not just an
  overwritten column).
- `GET /vehicles/me/health` — returns `{ score, message, factorsConsidered, factorsTotal,
  maintenanceItems[] }`. `score` is `null` (with `message` explaining why) when none of the 3
  scoring factors (service / insurance / PUC — see `CarHealthService` for the exact
  deterministic formula) have data yet. **Never** returns a fabricated default score.
- `GET /vehicles/me/service-records` — the vehicle's service history, newest first.
- `POST /vehicles/me/service-records` — body `{ serviceDate, odometerKm, serviceType, notes?,
  cost?, workshopName?, partsReplaced? }`. Also advances `vehicles.odometer_km` if the
  record's reading is higher than what's on file (a real reading the user just gave us, not
  an inferred one), and updates the vehicle's "last service" fields when the record's
  `serviceType` is an Oil Change / General Service and it's the most recent one on file.


- `POST /sos` — body `{ lat, lng }` → creates the event, pushes `sos:nearby_alert` to nearby MECHANIC/HELPER accounts individually over the WebSocket (never a broadcast), returns `{ sos, nearbyMechanicsNotified }`
- `GET /sos/active?lat&lng&radius` — MECHANIC/HELPER role only (was open to any authenticated user with no radius filter in the old Node backend, including the triggering user's phone + vehicle reg in every row — fixed; phone number is not returned by this endpoint at all)
- `GET /sos/mine` — the caller's own SOS history
- `POST /sos/{id}/resolve` — ownership-checked via a scoped query (`findByIdAndUserId`), 404s if the event doesn't belong to the caller instead of silently no-op'ing `{success:true}` like the old Node route did

**AI Mechanic**
- `POST /ai/chat` — session ownership enforced
- `GET /ai/sessions`

**Safety / Aadhaar**
- `POST /selfie/submit`, `GET /selfie/status`
- `POST /aadhaar/submit` (front + back image) → `{ result: LIKELY_TAMPERED | LIKELY_NOT_TAMPERED | REVIEW_REQUIRED }`, never claims official authenticity
- `GET /admin/selfies/pending`, `PUT /admin/selfies/{id}/review`
- `GET /admin/aadhaar/pending`, `PUT /admin/aadhaar/{id}/review`

**Daily / Engagement**
- `GET /daily/streak`, `POST /daily/streak/checkin`
- `GET /daily/tips`
- `GET /daily/alerts`, `POST /daily/alerts`, `POST /daily/alerts/{id}/vote` (one vote per user, changeable, not incrementable)
- `GET /places/nearby`
- `GET /fuel-rates`, `GET /fuel-rates/states`

**WebSocket** — `wss://.../ws`, `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header on the handshake request
(same header/token every REST call uses — NOT `?userId=` or `?token=` in the query string, which
is what both the old Node backend and this doc's earlier draft assumed; a query-string token
would be logged in server access logs and browser history, so the Android OkHttp client sets it
as a real handshake header instead). Identity is derived by JwtAuthFilter before the WebSocket
handshake handler ever runs — implemented in `AuthHandshakeInterceptor`.
Server events (all sent via targeted `sendToUser`, never a broadcast):
- `job:status_change` — sent to the other participant only, on accept/complete/cancel
- `job:helper_location` — relayed from a `job:location_update` client message, only after
  verifying the sender is actually a participant on that job, to the *other* participant only
- `sos:nearby_alert` — sent individually to each MECHANIC/HELPER found within
  `NOTIFY_RADIUS_KM` (15km) of a new SOS event; payload is `{ sosId, lat, lng }`, no phone number
Client events: `job:location_update` (`{ job_id, lat, lng }`), `driver:ping` (accepted, currently
a no-op — no standalone live-location store exists yet, same as the old Node stub)
Not implemented yet: `job:new_request`, `job:taken` (no server-side trigger point wired for
either; jobs are still discovered by polling `GET /jobs`)

## Still to audit before Phase 2 is "done"
- `admin.js` `/stats` endpoint — fold into final AdminController
- Shop routes — not found in current backend at all despite Flutter having a shop screen; needs its own decision (spec says "never fake it" — likely ships as "coming soon" state)
- Subscription/payment routes — not found in current backend; Razorpay/Cashfree keys mentioned in memory but no route file exists yet

**Helper application (Aadhaar/selfie verification, Phase 7)**
- `POST /helper/apply` (multipart: aadhaarFront, aadhaarBack required; selfie, email optional) — stores each image (Postgres BYTEA), runs AiTamperScreeningProvider (advisory only, defaults to `UNAVAILABLE` — no real AI key configured in this environment, never a fabricated verdict), creates/resubmits a PENDING application. 409 if already PENDING.
- `GET /helper/application/me` — 404 `NO_APPLICATION` if never applied
- `GET /helper/documents/{docId}` — raw image bytes, authorized to the doc's owner or ADMIN only
- `GET /admin/helper-applications` (PENDING queue), `GET /admin/helper-applications/{id}`, `POST .../approve` (sets user role → HELPER), `POST .../reject` (body `{reason}`) — ADMIN role only, read from the verified JWT, never client-supplied. No Android UI for these — admin review is out of scope for the consumer app.
- Never implemented: UIDAI/eKYC, OTP verification, biometric/face matching — per the migration brief's Aadhaar MVP limits.


## Home real-data endpoints (V11)

All are authenticated; identity comes from the JWT, never from the request.

| Endpoint | Returns | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /home/summary` | `weeklyKm{km,since,fullWindow,unavailableReason}`, `helpsGivenThisWeek`, `unreadNotifications` | `vehicle_odometer_logs`, `jobs` (COMPLETED as helper, 7d), `user_notifications` |
| `GET /fuel-log/summary` | `periodDays, fillUps, totalSpent, totalLitres?, lastFilledAt?, hasAnyLogs` | `fuel_logs` (7d) |
| `POST /fuel-log` | created `FuelLogDto`; needs `totalCost` OR (`litres` + `pricePerLitre`); optional `odometerKm` also advances the vehicle odometer (forward only) | `fuel_logs` |
| `GET /fuel-log` | latest fill-ups (`?limit`, max 100) | `fuel_logs` |
| `GET /notifications`, `POST /notifications/read-all` | inbox + mark seen | `user_notifications` (every `NotificationService.send` persists a row) |
| `GET /ai/status` | `state AVAILABLE/UNAVAILABLE`, `available` (= provider credential configured; does not prove reachability) | `AiMechanicProvider.isConfigured()` |
| `GET /fuel-rates` | now also `source`: `ADMIN_MANUAL` or `SEED_INDICATIVE` (seed rows are not live prices) | `fuel_rates.source` |

`weeklyKm.km` is `null` unless the vehicle has at least two real odometer readings. If the vehicle is newer than 7 days, `fullWindow=false` and `since` is the first reading's time.

## Job lifecycle (wire names: PENDING = requested, MATCHED = accepted; COMPLETED + `rated` = rated)
PENDING -> MATCHED -> ARRIVED -> IN_PROGRESS -> WORK_DONE -> COMPLETED (-> rated). Terminal: CANCELLED, EXPIRED.
- `POST /jobs/{id}/accept` approved+ACTIVE+unblocked helper with no commission due (403 otherwise; 409 if taken)
- `POST /jobs/{id}/arrive` body `{lat,lng,otp}`: GPS within `raahi.job.arrival-radius-m` and/or arrival OTP
- `POST /jobs/{id}/start` helper; `POST /jobs/{id}/work-done` helper `{finalAmount,paymentMode: CASH|UPI}`
- `POST /jobs/{id}/confirm-completion` customer `{otp}`; creates the commission ledger row
- `POST /jobs/{id}/rate` customer `{stars,comment}`; `POST /jobs/{id}/cancel` only PENDING/MATCHED (409 CANCEL_NOT_ALLOWED after ARRIVED)
- `POST /jobs/{id}/report` participants (Report Issue / Contact Support); `GET /jobs/{id}/history` immutable status history
## Helper portal
`GET /helper/status`, `PUT /helper/availability`, `GET /helper/commission`, `GET /helper/earnings`, `GET /helper/ratings`, `GET /helper/jobs/history`, `POST /helper/apply` (multipart, full onboarding)
## Admin (`/admin/**`, ROLE_ADMIN + DB re-check, all mutations audited)
overview, users (+block/unblock), helpers (+suspend/reinstate), helper-applications approve/reject, jobs, jobs/{id}/history, reports (+resolve), cancellations (+excuse), ratings, commission/balances|ledger|settle, audit-logs
## Commission
Ledger (not a wallet). `raahi.commission.rate` (default 10%). COMMISSION rows negative, SETTLEMENT rows positive; balance < 0 blocks accepting jobs.
