/**
 * Runs [block], returning its data on success. On failure:
 *  - HttpException (any non-2xx response): parses the response body as ApiEnvelope<*> and
 *    throws IllegalStateException with the real ApiErrorBody.message, falling back to a
 *    generic message only if the body isn't in the expected shape.
 *  - Any other exception (network failure, timeout, etc.): rethrown as-is so callers can
 *    distinguish "server said no" from "couldn't reach the server" if they need to.
 *
 * Every repository's suspend network calls should go through this rather than reading
 * envelope.error directly, since that path is only ever reached for 2xx responses with
 * success=false, which none of this backend's controllers actually return — they use real
 * HTTP status codes (404/409/403/503) for failures instead.
